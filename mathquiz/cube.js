"1323 = 3X3X3 X7X7 <br> By dividing into groups of 3, we see that the term 7 has appeared only twice.<br>If we multiply by 7, the number becomes perfect cube.<br>So 7 is our answer",
"72 = 2X2X2 X 3X3<br>As there is only two 3s, if we multiply the number by 3, it becomes perfect cube<br>Answer is 3",
"1728 = 2X2X2 X2X2X2 X3X3X3<br>So the cube root is 2X2X3 = 12",
"Using prime factorization method we see that 8000 = 2X2X2X10X10X10. <br>Factors can be divided into groups of 3.<br> So 8000 is a cube. 400 = 2X2X10X10. So it is not perfect cube. 81 = 3X3X3X3 and 25 = 5X5. So these are not perfect cubes either",
"15625 = 5X5X5 X5X5X5. So cube root of 15625 is 5X5 = 125",
"13824 = 8 X 8 X 8 X 27. So cube root of 13824 = 2X2X2X3 = 24" ,
"375 = 5X5X5X 3. So by removing 3, we get 125, which is a perfect cube",
"216 = 8 X 27. As 8 and 27 are perfect cubes, their product is perfect cube.<br> 1000=10X10X10. So 1000 is perfect cube.<br> 100=2X2X5X5. It is not perfect cube.<br>128=2X2X2 X2X2X2X 2. So 128 is not perfect cube",
"In number 4913 make groups of 3 digits starting from last digit.<br>We get 4 - 913<br>913 ends with 3. 7 cube ends with 3<br>So last digit of cube root is 7<br>4 lies between cubes 1 and 8<br>We take lower value 1 and its cube root is 1<br>First digit is 1- the cube root is 17",
