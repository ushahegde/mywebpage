<p>  Prime Factors of a given number
 </p>
<h3>Write a program to find all prime factors of a given number. </h3>

<p>The program should print the factors of a number which are prime. 
</p>
One way of writing this is 
<ul>
   <li> If the number is divisible by 2, repeatedly divide the number by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2.
  </li>   <li>Print 2 as a factor if number is divisible.
     </li>
    <li> In a loop for values of i from 3 to n in steps of 2, find if a number is divisible by i. </li>
    <li> If yes repeatedly divide by i as long as number is divisible.</li> 
</ul>
   
   here is the code for it
   <pre>
   <code> void printFactors(int num){
          if(num%2==0){
            System.out.println("2 ");
            while (num%2==0)
             num = num/2;
          }
        
          for(int i=3;i<=num;i+=2){
               if(num%i==0){
                    System.out.println(i);
                  while(num%i==0)
                     num = num/i;
               }
          }

     }
   </code>         
      </pre>
